# Got a minute?(Orginizational feedback)
Our project is about the feedback box  which is the conventional way to communicate complaints or suggestions in any company or organization.
This approach isn't available to everyone, and it doesn't keep track of complaints either.
The goal of the proposed project is to create an engaging and dynamic online feedback portal for every employee who is working in the organization with any discomort and also at ease.
